# What is DAOstar?

DAOstar is the standards body of the DAO ecosystem. We build and maintain interoperable frameworks that empower decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) and related entities across the Web.

Many of our standards, starting with EIP-4824 (a.k.a. DAOIP-2), focus on defining a common interface for DAOs, similar to how tokenURI functions for NFTs. By setting consistent metadata protocols for DAOs of all types, DAOstar enhances their discoverability, improves transparency for members, and ensures compatibility with future tools and services.

While many DAOs already publish operational data in various formats, DAOstar formalizes and standardizes these practices, making it simpler to create, manage, and maintain DAOs and the tools that support them.

### Mission

The mission of DAOstar is to support the long-term success and sustainability of the DAO ecosystem including DAOs, DAO participants, and DAO service providers. We do this by

(1) developing technical standards that unify and strengthen the DAO ecosystem,
(2) building, organizing, and funding public goods that benefit DAO communities, and
(3) setting long-term vision and cultivating leaders to guide the DAO ecosystem into the future, ensuring a clear path for growth and adaptation over the next decade.

### Vision
DAOstar envisions a future where DAOs and other digitally-constituted organizations become the global standard for governance in both commercial and community contexts. Our goal is a world where DAOs manage [more assets and production than traditional legal entities](https://mirror.xyz/thelastjosh.eth/KJVBCZhszM3Gl6VkMMcxKsR47au0xtt-dlcvZ644yKg).

### Strategy

DAOstar focuses on fostering the growth of the DAO ecosystem through a deliberate emphasis on long-term impact. We build standards, publish research, organize events, and operate or fund a variety of public goods relevant to DAO communities.

Some of our efforts have focused on data infrastructure DAOs, regulatory interoperability, grants management, and attestation infrastructure. For more current details, visit our most recent roadmap:
