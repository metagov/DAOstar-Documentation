# API Documentation

To try out our API, you can interact with it via our front facing user interface hosted at [daostar.org/api](https://daostar.org/api).

For developers interested in using the API directly, you've come to the right place!

The DAOstar API service is hosted at [api.daostar.org](https://api.daostar.org) and you can [view our Swagger documentation here](https://daostar.org/api/docs).

## Basic Example

Our API service allows developers to submit EIP-4824 compatible DAO JSON-LD schemas to be stored on both IPFS and our database to easily propogate and serve the data. 

To create a new immutable DAO schema, simply send a POST request to `https://api.daostar.org/immutable`. The request body should be a JSON object with the following format:
```json
{
  "data": {
    "name": "<DAO name>",
    "description": "<DAO description>",
    "membersURI": "<DAO members URI>",
    "proposalsURI": "<DAO proposals URI>",
    "activityLogURI": "<DAO activity log URI>",
    "governanceURI": "<DAO members URI>"
  }
}
```
This API call will return a JSON object with the following format:
```json
{
  "url": "https://api.daostar.org/immutable/<CID>",
  "cid": "<CID>"
}
```
The returned URL is a static endpoint that will serve the JSON schema that was just posted through our API service via a GET request. Additionally, the returned CID (content identifier) allows the schema to be accessed directly from the IPFS network without going through our API service.
